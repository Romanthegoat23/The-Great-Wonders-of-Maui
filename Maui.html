    <p>Maui is the second biggest island in the Hawaiian chain. It is 727.2 square miles and has a population of 144,444.</p>
     
    <h3>My trip to Twin Falls</h3>
    <p>Late in the trip to Maui me and my family went to Twin Falls. Twin Falls is a waterfall that is located on the Road to Hana. The Road to Hana is a long drive around the island with stops along the way.<p>
        <p>When we got there we had to walk about a mile to get the falls. Once we arrived we felt the water and it was freezing. After taking a few pictures we decided to get in the water. When my body hit the water it was shivering, but was worth it.</p>
<h3>Whale Watching</h3>
<p> Earlier in the trip my dad and I went whale watching on kyaks. We woke up one morning and got dressed and took the 25 minute drive to the meet location. Once we got there we got on the water we where out there for a total of 2 hours and saw 3 whales. At the end of the trip we saw a whale right beneath us. Then the guide asked us if we water to stick our heads underneath the water to here the whale sing. I was very nervous but at the end of the day it paid off.</p> 
<h3>Trip to South Maui Fish Company</h3>
<p> In the middle of the trip the whale watching guide told us about a great fish place that sells fresh fish. So we wnet there and got a poke bowl. A poke bowl is a meal with raw fish, rice and cole slaw. The fish was freesh tuna they caught that same exact day. The fish was so pure and delicious. This was the best fish i've ever had in my life.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Overall my trip to Maui was unforgettable and a great and fun experience with the family! </p>
